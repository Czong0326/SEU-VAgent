Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.

Because the \"black-box\" model of the mCell is the same regardless of whether the driving force is STT, the spin Hall effect, or something else, this macro-model can be used for any effect so long as the directionality of input current determines the resistance state of an electrically-isolated read-path. However, the parameters (and some empirically-fit behavior) are currently tuned for STT-based domain wall motion.\n\nThis model is primarily intended for use in digital simulations (i.e., where the pulses are nominally square in shape).\n\nThe model defines a discipline representing the location and velocity of the domain wall (modeled with infinitesimal width for simplicity). This is internal to the model; only the external electrical ports (read- and write-terminals) are visible to the user. To initiate switching, the current density must exceed a threshold value that is dependent on the pulse width. Here, we calculate an average value of the write-path current density over a variable time window; if the average value exceeds a calculated depinning time (based on an empirical fit to micromagnetic simulation data), the domain wall is depinned. Once this occurs, the velocity of the domain wall is linearly proportional to the current density. Smooth exponential functions are used to model transitional behavior; such functions are also used to \"clamp\" the domain wall at its endpoints on either side of the device. A \"restoring force\" is also modeled that slowly brings the domain wall back to x=0, where the magnetization in the read-path and write-path are parallel and the energy is at a global minimum. The resistance of the read-path is a function of the domain wall location. A flag is available to indicate whether or not the user wishes to simulate the device with two magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the read-path, or one MTJ and one ohmic contact.\n\nThe characteristics of this model (particularly the empirical fit to depinning) are based on a specific set of device parameters and physical effects modeled in simulation only. The critical current density and switching time ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT for all possible mCell parameters (e.g., write-path thickness, interlayer exchange coupling strength, write-path anisotropy, etc.).\n\nA special note about the depinning time function: this was extracted from micromagnetic simulation data that modeled pulse widths from 1-10 ns. It is unknown if the trend continues for wider pulses.\n\nA special note about sizing: the critical current density and switching time were found to not vary appreciably in a range of width from 10-50 nm (assuming zero edge roughness). It is unknown if these trends continue for wider devices.\n\nAuthors: Daniel H. Morris, David M.
