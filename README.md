# VAgentï¼šMulti-Agent Framework for Closed-Loop Verilog-A Generation and SPICE-Verified Synthesis
This repository contains dataset,standard model,and fine-tuning adjustments to reproduce experiments in the paper.
# Introduction
This research is one of the first in the industry to study the auxiliary correction of VerilogA code and circuit design by LLM. It is based on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B standard model and was fine-tuned with over 5,000 pieces of VerilogA code. It has been verified to provide excellent guidance for circuit design using Verilog code.
